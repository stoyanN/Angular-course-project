# Angular App
This is an angular application generated by Angular CLI. 
The project is a simple dog's blog website. It has the normal operations like register user, login user, create article, edit article, like or dislike an article and if you are the creator of the post - you can delete it.

## Instalation
run `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
Then you can run `ng s` to run the application locally on your computer or you can visit the deployed version on heroku https://snenkov-angular.herokuapp.com/ .

## Database 
For this project I used Backendless BaaS. So after the 6th of January the project might be destroyed.

## Cloud Storage
The images uploaded for the articles are stored in https://cloudinary.com/ .
